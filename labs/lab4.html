<h4>Need a Hint?</h4>
<p>
The result from calling <code>scanf</code> can be assigned to an integer, like so:
</p><pre class="program">
int scanned_in_value;
int result = scanf("%d", &amp;scanned_in_value);
</pre>
<p>
<code>result</code> will be equal to the number of variables that scanf
successfully scanned in.
</p><p>
<strong>Explanation</strong><br/>
In the code sample above, if the user does enter a number, scanf will be able to
read this in to the variable <code>scanned_in_value</code>, and thus it will
have successfully scanned in one value (since there is only one <code>%d</code>,
so the variable <code>result</code> will contain the value 1.
</p><p>
If the user had not entered a valid number (for example if they typed in a word
instead), there would be no integer there for scanf to read into
<code>scanned_in_value</code>, so scanf would not successfully scan in any
values, and so the variable <code>result</code> would contain a different value.
</p><p>
<strong>Detecting the end of input</strong><br/>
The variable <code>result</code> can be used to determine whether your program
has reached the end of the input (hint: if there aren't any values left for
scanf to scan in, the <code>result</code> variable <em>won't</em> contain the
number <code>1</code>).
</p><p>
If you have a <code>while</code> loop condition that checks the result of
<code>scanf</code> to determine whether scanf was able to successfully scan the
expected number of variables, you can use this information to keep scanning
numbers until the user tells you to stop.
</p><p>
Note: on Mac/Linux, you can signal "end of input" on the command line by pressing
<kbd>Control + D</kbd>

    </small><br/>Create a Simple Calculator, Reading Different Numbers of Integers</h3></header>
<p>For this exercise, make a program called <code>cs_calculator.c</code> which 
will scan in instructions until EOF and prints the output as specified below. An instruction is a sequence of positive integers. The first integer identifies what 
type the instruction is.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the first number in the instruction is <code>1</code>, then your program 
should print out the square of the next number in the instruction.</li>
<li>If the first number in the instruction is <code>2</code>, then your program 
should print out the value of the next number raised to the power of the number 
after next.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assume that the first number in the instruction is only either 
<code>1</code> or <code>2</code></p>
<p>You can assume that for each instruction, the correct number of successive 
positive integers will be given.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The autotest for this exercise expects your program to end WITHOUT a 
new line character when the user presses Ctrl+D. This means that the command prompt for the next command 
should be on the same line as the end of your program.</p>
<p>One major challenge of this exercise is figuring out how to use <code>scanf</code> effectively.
The lessons you learn in this exercise regarding <code>scanf</code> will be useful in the first assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: You can scan in the first number initially, and based 
on the value of that first number then scan in the correct number of additional numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: <code>scanf</code> will jump over and ignore any 
whitespace characters including newline characters. Be careful not to overrun 
or underrun your input.</p>
<p>There is no need to print a newline character after the user presses Ctrl+D</p>

    </small><br/>Help Route an Electric Car Along a Long Road</h3></header>
<div class="alert alert-danger">
<h5>This challenge does not provide comprehensive test cases</h5>
<p>
    You have been provided some autotests to check your output is sane,
    and that it is in a correct format. Passing the autotests does not
    guarantee that you have solved this challenge -- your own testing
    will be required.
</p></div>
<p>
    You are in charge of planning a route for an electric car
    across a long road.
</p><p>
    Your electric car takes exactly one unit of charge to travel
    one kilometer. It has infinite battery capacity, but starts off empty.
</p><p>
    Conveniently, every kilometer along this road, there is a charging
    station, where you can stop to charge your car. These charging stations
    may have a limited of supply of charge you can use to charge your car.
    A charging station may have no charge available.
</p><p>
    Your job is to determine if it is possible to drive your car to the
    last charging station on the road, and if so,
    what the minimum number of stops is to get your car there.

</p><h3>Input Format</h3>
You should write a C program, <code>going_electric.c</code>.

This program will be provided a series of numbers. Each number represents
the charge available from a given charging station. The first number given
is the charge of the first station (where your car begins its journey).
The second number given is the charge at the second station, and so on.

<h3>Output Format</h3>
Your program should print a single integer, the minimum number of charging stops required
to cross the road. This should include the initial charging stop.

If it is not possible to drive all the way along the road, you should print
the integer 0.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">dcc going_electric.c -o going_electric</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">./going_electric</kbd>
<kbd>2 0 0</kbd>
<span class="eof"></span>
1
</pre>
<p>
In the above example, the car had to charge at the first station. It then had
2 units of charge, which let it reach the final station.
Note that even though that final charging station had no charge to give,
the car successfully reached it (just), so this journey is possible.
</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">./going_electric</kbd>
<kbd>2 0 0 3 0</kbd>
<span class="eof"></span>
0
</pre>
<p>
    In the above example, the car could not make it to the last charging
    station -- the two units of charge at the first station aren't
    enough to drive to the next charging station with more charge.
</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">./going_electric</kbd>
<kbd>1 1 1 1 0</kbd>
<span class="eof"></span>
4
</pre>
<p>
    In the above example, the car charges at each of the four stations
    it can. In this way, it just makes it to the final charging station.
</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">./going_electric</kbd>
<kbd>3 3 2 1 0</kbd>
<span class="eof"></span>
2
</pre>
<p>
    In the above example, the car must charge twice, but there are
    three possible ways it could do so -- it must charge at
    the first station, but then it could charge at any of the
    others (excluding the last).
</p>
<h3>Assumptions, Restrictions &amp; Clarifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>The road will have no more than 10000 charging stations.</li>
<li>The road is longer than 1 kilometer (that is, it has at least two charging stations). </li>
<li>A charging station always has a non-negative amount of charge (that is, either a charging station has a positive amount of charge, or no charge at all).</li>
</ul>

<h4>An Extra Challenge From The Author</h4>
<p>
As backstory, this challenge was written in a single night,
after I <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd-sniped</a> myself.
</p><p>
I'm pretty sure the solution I have to this question is correct,
but I invite anyone who is really interested in this problem to
submit a mathematical proof of their code being correct. If
doing so interests you, you may find the courses COMP3121, COMP4161,
COMP2111 and COMP6721 interesting.
</p><p>
Submit your proof via the <a href="mailto:cs1511.challenge@cse.unsw.edu.au">cs1511.challenge@cse.unsw.edu.au</a> email (be sure to include your zID).
Extra Marcs (which aren't worth Marks, but are worth street cred) are available!

<strong>New!</strong>
You can run an automated code style checker using the following command:

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1511 style going_electric.c</kbd>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
When you think your program is working,
you can use <code>autotest</code>
to run some simple automated tests:

</p><pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1511 autotest going_electric</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
When you are finished working on this exercise,

you must

submit your work by running <code>give</code>:

</p><pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">give cs1511 lab04_going_electric going_electric.c</kbd>
</pre>
<p>

You must run <code>give</code>

before <strong>Sunday 11 October 20:00</strong>
to obtain the marks for this lab exercise.


Note that this is an individual exercise,
the work you submit with <code>give</code> must be entirely your own.







    </p></section>
<section class="exercise">
<header><h3>Submission</h3></header>
    


When you are finished each exercises make sure you submit your work by running <code>give</code>.
<p>
You can run <code>give</code> multiple times.
Only your last submission will be marked.
</p><p>
Don't submit any exercises you haven't attempted.
</p><p>
If you are working at home, you may find it more convenient
to upload your work via
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/Student/give.php">give's web interface</a>.
</p><p>
Remember you have until

<b>Week 4 Sunday 20:00</b>

to submit your work.
</p><p>
You cannot obtain marks by e-mailing your code to tutors or lecturers.
</p><p>
You check the files you have submitted <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/student/">here</a>.
</p><p>
Automarking will be run by the lecturer several days after the submission deadline,
using test cases different to those <code>autotest</code> runs for you.
(Hint: do your own testing as well as running <code>autotest</code>.)
</p><p>
After automarking is run by the lecturer
you can <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/student/">view your results here</a>.
The resulting mark will also be available
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/Student/sturec.php">via give's web interface</a>.

</p><h4>Lab Marks</h4>
<p>
When all components of a lab  are automarked you should be able to view the
the marks <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/Student/sturec.php">via give's web interface</a>
or by running this command on a CSE machine:
