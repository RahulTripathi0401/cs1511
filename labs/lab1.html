<header><h3>Setting Up Your Own Computer to Work on COMP1511</h3></header>
<p>Since the course this term is 100% online, you'll need to work on your own
computer.
</p><p>Don't worry about the age or specifications of the computer itself, even
reasonably old computers will be able to handle the work we're doing in COMP1511.

</p><p>If you don't have a computer where you live, please contact cs1511@cse.unsw.edu.au
and we'll see what we can do to help.

</p><p>It's useful to try and set up your laptop (if you have one) during a lab class
because your tutor or other students may be able to help you with any
problems.</p>
<p>Otherwise, try to set up your laptop and/or desktop this week so you can
work on COMP1511 at home.</p>
</section>
<section class="exercise">
<header><h3>Logging In</h3></header>
<p>This term, you will need to use VLab to connect to CSE. There's more
    information about how to do that <a href="https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP1511/20T3/resources/51389">at the Home Computing link</a>.
</p><p>To log in, you use your zID (which looks something like
<code>z1234567</code>) and your zPass (which is used to log into all other
university online services).</p>
<p>The CSE labs use the Linux operating system (not Windows or OSX or ...).</p>
<p>When you log in, by default, you'll be using the xfce4 window manager, and
you'll see a linux desktop.</p>
<p>If you are asked to select a panel click on <b>Use default config</b>, as in
    the image below.</p>
<img height="300" src="default.png"/>
<p>Along with menus that you can see, such as the Applications Menu in the top
left corner, it also has a simple menu you can access by <b>right-clicking
anywhere on the desktop</b>.</p>
<p>Have a look around and see if you can work out how to open a web browser.</p>
</section>
<section class="exercise">
<header><h3>Exercise 0: Trying out some Linux Commands</h3></header>
<p>Although there are lots of things you can do by using the graphical user
interface (GUI) - clicking on menu items and icons, we really want you
understand how to use the Linux command-line.</p>
<p>If you get stuck with any of this, don't hesitate to ask one of your tutors
for help, that's why they're here!</p>
<p>If there isn't a terminal open, right click on the desktop and select 'Open
Terminal Here'</p>
<p>This will bring up a window where you can type in Linux commands.</p>
<p>There are a few commands that you can use to check your account details:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rquota</code> tells you how much of your disk quota you've used
up (from creating files)</li>
<li><code>acc</code> tells you your name, what classes you're in, where
your home directory is and other details that may or may not be useful</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is a command, and when entering into your terminal, you need
to press enter (or return) after each command. Try the two we just mentioned
above.</p>
<p>Now try running the command <code>date</code> - which prints the current
time and date.</p>
<p>You should see something like this:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">date</kbd>
Monday 26 February  12:15:20 AEDT 2018
</pre>
<p>Now we're going to learn about some commands for working with directories
(directories are often called folders on other operating systems).</p>
<ul>
<li>pwd</li>
<li>ls</li>
<li>cd</li>
<li>mkdir</li>
</ul>
<p>The Linux command <code>pwd</code> tells you what directory you are in,
often called your <i>current working directory</i>.</p>
<p><code>pwd</code> stands for '<strong>p</strong>rint <strong>w</strong>orking
<strong>d</strong>irectory'.</p>
<p>If your username is 'z7654321', and you enter the 'pwd'
command into the terminal, it might tell you:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">pwd</kbd>
/import/cage/1/z7654321/Desktop
</pre>
<p>This means that I'm in the Desktop directory inside my (z7654321's)
home directory<i></i>and my home directory is stored on the file server called
<i>cage</i>.</p>
<p>What does <code>pwd</code> print for you?</p>
<p>The Linux command <code>ls</code> prints a <b>l</b>i<b>s</b>t of the files
in the present directory. Since you have a new account there will probably be
nothing in your Desktop directory.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">ls</kbd>
</pre>
<p>The Linux command <code>cd</code> is a command that you can use to
<strong>c</strong>hange your <strong>d</strong>irectory.</p>
<p>If you type in cd on its own as follows, you will move into your home
directory.</p>
<p>Try this out and confirm your directory has changed by running
<code>pwd</code> again.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">pwd</kbd>
/import/cage/1/z7654321/Desktop
<kbd is="sh">cd</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">pwd</kbd>
/import/cage/1/z7654321
</pre>
<p>If you run <code>ls</code> you'll see what is in your home directory. Since
you have a new account, your home directory will most likely only contain your
Desktop and a directory called public_html (which is where you can create files
to create websites).</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">ls</kbd>
Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures public_html Videos
</pre>
<p>The Linux command <code>mkdir</code> <strong>m</strong>a<strong>k</strong>es
a new <strong>dir</strong>ectory. To use it you must supply the name of the
directory you wish to create.  Lets use it to create a directory for this
week's lab exercises.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">mkdir lab01</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Now the command <code>ls</code> should show you the directory you just
created.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">ls</kbd>
Desktop lab01 public_html
</pre>
<p>Now we will use <code>cd</code> in a slightly different way where we tell it
what directory we want to change into.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">cd lab01</kbd>
</pre>
<p>To confirm we really are in our new created <i>lab01</i> directory type the
  <code>pwd</code> command again.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">pwd</kbd>
/import/cage/1/z7654321/lab01
</pre>
<p>If all this has worked, it's time to try compiling your first program!</p>
</section>
<section class="exercise">
<header><h3>Exercise 1: Your first program</h3></header>
<p>Now it's time to create a file. We are going to use the text editor
<em>gedit</em>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Tip: you can run a command to help set up your CSE account for COMP1511,
which will configure gedit and set up some default programs.</p>
<p>In a terminal, type (without the dollar sign):</p>
<pre is="tty"><kbd is="sh">1511 setup</kbd></pre>
<p>and press enter.</p>
</div>
<p>To create a file using gedit, type:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">gedit bad_pun.c &amp;</kbd>
</pre>
<p>This will open up a graphical editor where you can manipulate text.</p>
<p>Adding the <code>&amp;</code> to the end of a command allows the GUI to
return control to the terminal as soon as it starts (i.e. run in the
background) rather than after it is closed. If you forget the
<code>&amp;</code>, you will not be able to type commands into the terminal
until the GUI application is finished. This is always a good idea when running
a command which invokes a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
<p>Here's an example of a simple C program. Copy it into the gedit window, and
save it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// A simple C program that attempts to be punny</span>
<span class="c1">// Written 23/2/2017</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When you save, it will place the contents of the editor into the file
<code>bad_pun.c</code>.</p>
<p><b>Handy Tip 1</b>: On many linux systems copying can be achieved by simply
highlighting with the left mouse button and pasting can be achieved by simply
clicking with the middle button.</p>
<p><b>Handy Tip 2</b>: Make sure gedit is displaying line numbers down the left
hand side. This is important for when we need to fix compile time errors.</p>
<p>The easiest way to set this up is by running <code>1511 setup</code> in your
terminal.</p>
<p>You can also change whether line numbers are displayed by going to the
Edit-&gt;Preferences menu item and selecting the 'Display Line Numbers' option.</p>
<p>Once you have pressed save, click on the Terminal window again and type this
command to compile your program:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">dcc -o bad_pun bad_pun.c</kbd>
</pre>
<p>The <code>-o bad_pun</code> option tells the compiler to givethe newly
compiled program the name <i>bad_pun</i>.</p>
<p>Test what happens if you leave the <code>-o  bad_pun</code> option out. What
is the default name <code>dcc</code> uses?</p>
<p>You may wish to use the <code>rm</code> command to delete
(<b>r</b>e<b>m</b>ove) the file created.</p>
<p>(You can Google <em>rm</em> or <em>rm linux</em> if you are not sure how it
works).</p>
<p>If <code>dcc</code> does not print out any error messages, then your program
has been successfully compiled. Otherwise you will need to find the errors in
your code, fix them, save the file and compile again.</p>
<p><b>Handy Tip 3</b>: Look for the line numbers that are displayed in the
error messages as they are major clues to where the problem is in your code.</p>
<p><b>Handy Tip 4</b>: Always start with fixing the first error first.
Sometimes fixing one compile error, saving and recompiling can make all or some
of the other errors go away!</p>
<p>After successfully compiling you can check that dcc has produced an
executable by typing <code>ls -l</code> and looking for a newly-created
<code>bad_pun</code> file (check the file creation time to see if it really is
new).</p>
<p>A useful Unix command is <b>man</b> short for <b>man</b>ual. Find out what
the <code>-l</code> option for the <code>ls</code> command you used before
does. Type:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">man ls</kbd>
</pre>
<p>In the manual page you can scroll using your arrow keys on your keyboard.
 Press 'q' to exit man.</p>
<p>Run the program to test that it works. Type:</p>
<p>Press 'q' to exit man.</p>
<p>Run the program to test that it works. Type:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">./bad_pun</kbd>
</pre>
<p>The <code>./</code> before the program name specifies that the program is
found in the current directory. Note that Unix executable (program) names do
not require the <code>.exe</code> extension that you might have have seen under
Windows.</p>
<p>The COMP1511 class account contains a script that automatically checks your
solution to lab exercises.</p>
<p>While it is not important this week, lets run the <code>autotest</code>
script so you can see what it does.</p>
<p>You can check <code>bad_pun.c</code> like this:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1511 autotest bad_pun bad_pun.c</kbd>
Test 0 (./bad_pun) - passed
1 tests passed  0 tests failed
</pre>
<p>Don't worry if you fail the check - and you can't see why.</p>
<p>There are no marks for this week's lab but practice submitting your work
electronically.</p>
<p>You submit your work with the <code>give</code> command like this:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">give cs1511 lab01_bad_pun bad_pun.c</kbd>
</pre>
<p>In future weeks both members of each lab pair need to submit your work using
<code>give</code>.</p>

<header><h3>Exercise 2: Creating an ASCII Bird</h3></header>
<!--<h3>Exercise 2: Creating an ASCII Bird</h3>-->
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Tip: you can run a command to help set up your CSE account for COMP1511,
which will configure gedit and set up some default programs.</p>
<p>In a terminal, type (without the dollar sign):</p>
<pre is="tty"><kbd is="sh">1511 setup</kbd></pre>
<p>and press enter.</p>
</div>
<p>Now use the Linux command <code>cp</code> to copy <code>bad_pun.c</code> to
a new file named <code>bird.c</code>, like this:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">cp bad_pun.c bird.c</kbd>
</pre>
<p>You are now ready to start editing the file <code>bird.c</code> using your
favourite editor.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">gedit bird.c &amp;</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Note that the basic structure of the program can be retained; you just need
to change the comments, and modify and/or add printf statements to the program.
Edit the file <code>bird.c</code> to produce a new program that behaves as
follows:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">dcc -o bird bird.c</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">./bird</kbd>
  ___
 ('v')
((___))
 ^   ^
</pre>
<p>Make sure you save your modified program before you compile it.</p>
<p>Make sure you re-compile your program every time you modify the code.</p>
<p><b>Handy Tip 5 :</b> Linux remembers the commands we have recently typed in.
By pressing the <kbd>UPARROW</kbd> key, it will bring up your previous command
and save you retyping it in! Try it. You can press the <kbd>UPARROW</kbd> key
repeatedly to go back to the second last command, third last command and so
on.</p>
<p><b>Handy Tip 6 :</b> At your Linux command prompt, type in <code>./b</code>
and then press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key. Linux will automatically try to fill in
your partially typed command for you!</p>
<p>Again try the automatic checking script in the class account.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1511 autotest bird bird.c</kbd>

<header><h3>Exercise 3: Fixing errors in an ASCII Kangaroo</h3></header>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Tip: you can run a command to help set up your CSE account for COMP1511,
which will configure gedit and set up some default programs.</p>
<p>In a terminal, type (without the dollar sign):</p>
<pre is="tty"><kbd is="sh">1511 setup</kbd></pre>
<p>and press enter.</p>
</div>
<p>Copy the program <code>kangaroo.c</code> from the course account to your
directory by typing (make sure you type the dot at the end):</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">cp ~cs1511/public_html/20T3/tlb/01/kangaroo.c .</kbd>
</pre>
<p>The dot '.' is a shorthand for the current directory and there is a space
between <code>kangaroo.c</code> and the next dot. You can check that the file
has been copied by typing:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">ls</kbd>
bad_pun bad_pun.c bird bird.c kangaroo.c
</pre>
<p>You can examine the contents of the file by typing:</p>

// Written 7/3/2017
/  by Andrew Taylor (andrewt@unsw.edu.au)
// as a lab example for COMP1511
...
</pre>
<p>(<code>less</code> is an improved version of an earlier utility called
<code>more</code>, which shows you long text files one page at a time and
allows you to go forward and back using the space bar and the 'B' key. Less is
more! Press 'q' to exit less.)</p>
<p>Now try to compile kangaroo.c. You should see a list of confusing error
messages.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">dcc -o kangaroo kangaroo.c</kbd>

 /  by Andrew Taylor (andrewt@cse.unsw.edu.au)
...
</pre>
<p>Your job is to fix the errors.</p>
<p>You'll need to use an editor to change the file <code>kangaroo.c</code></p>
<p>Run gedit like this:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">gedit kangaroo.c &amp;</kbd>
</pre>
<p>When you have fixed all the errors you should be able to do this.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">dcc -o kangaroo kangaroo.c</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">./kangaroo</kbd>

  /\   ___
 &lt;__\_/    \
    \_  /  _\
      \_\ / \\
        //   \\
      =//     \==

</pre>
<p><b>Hint</b>: the error messages are confusing but they usually indicate
where the problem is.</p>
<p><b>Hint</b>: treat it as a puzzle. Look for differences between your program
and the working programs you have been shown.</p>
<p><b>Hint</b>: all the errors but one involve a single missing character.</p>
<p><b>Hint</b>: if it looks like there are too many backslashes in the program,
it is correct. <b>Don't delete any backslashes</b> (you do need to add one
backslash). It was mentioned in lectures that the backslash has a special
interpretation in C.</p>

<header><h3>Exercise 6: Lab 0 (Optional)</h3></header>
<p>CSESoc is the School's Constituent Society. This means that by doing
COMP1511, you're automatically a member! They sometimes run a workshop called
"Lab 0" . The workshop covers some of the basics of the School of CSE, and of
  being in COMP1511. You can find a link to Lab 0's material under the Week 1
  material on WebCMS (under "Tuts, Labs &amp; Tests"). You don't have to do it, but
  if you want to learn more about CSE you can read it!

<header><h3>Exercise 7: [Challenge] Message of the Day</h3></header>
<p>A Message of the Day (often called an "MotD") is a message traditionally
shown when you log into a unix system. It usually gives you a warm greeting and
tells you some information.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will make your own MotD. You do not need to submit it,
nor is it directly assessed in any way. It is, however, an opportunity for you
to demonstrate your creative skills to your new friends and tutors. You can
even keep adding to it throughout the term.</p>
<p>To get started, run the following command. It will show the following
output.</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1511 motd</kbd>
Did not find a MotD! You should make a file called motd.c and compile it.
</pre>
<p>This program has just enabled an MotD on your shell, but now you need to
specify what it will say.</p>
<p>Make a new file called <code>motd.c</code> in your home directory. If you're
not in your home directory, type the command <code>cd</code> to go there.</p>
<p>You should make this program print out a message of the day, like "Hi Tom,
I'm looking forward to COMP1511".</p>
<p>When you're done, you can run:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">dcc -o motd motd.c</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">./motd</kbd>
Hi Tom, I'm looking forward to COMP1511.
</pre>
<p>To get rid of the message, remove the motd file:</p>
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">rm motd</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Now that you've got it working, here are some ways to make your motd stand
out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make some ASCII text: <a href="http://patorjk.com/software/taag/">Here's an ASCII text
generator!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.theurbanpenguin.com/adding-color-to-your-output-from-c/">Add
some color to your message!</a></li>
<li>Add some ASCII art (a time honored tradition in computing): <a href="https://www.asciiart.eu/">Here's one collection - google for
more!</a></li>
</ul>

<header><h3>Submission</h3></header>
    


When you are finished each exercises make sure you submit your work by running <code>give</code>.
<p>
You can run <code>give</code> multiple times.
Only your last submission will be marked.
</p><p>
Don't submit any exercises you haven't attempted.
</p><p>
If you are working at home, you may find it more convenient
to upload your work via
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/Student/give.php">give's web interface</a>.
</p><p>
Remember you have until

<b>Week 2 Monday 20:00</b>

to submit your work.
</p><p>
You cannot obtain marks by e-mailing your code to tutors or lecturers.
</p><p>
You check the files you have submitted <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/student/">here</a>.
</p><p>
Automarking will be run by the lecturer several days after the submission deadline,
using test cases different to those <code>autotest</code> runs for you.
(Hint: do your own testing as well as running <code>autotest</code>.)
</p><p>
After automarking is run by the lecturer
you can <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/student/">view your results here</a>.
The resulting mark will also be available
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/Student/sturec.php">via give's web interface</a>.

</p><h4>Lab Marks</h4>
<p>
When all components of a lab  are automarked you should be able to view the
the marks <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/Student/sturec.php">via give's web interface</a>
or by running this command on a CSE machine:

</p><pre is="tty">
