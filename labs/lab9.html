<header><h3><small style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">Exercise â€” in pairs:
    </small><br/>Check whether a Linked List is in Increasing Order</h3></header>
<p>
Download list_increasing.c <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/activities/list_increasing/list_increasing.c">here</a>, or copy it to your CSE
account using the following command:

</p><pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">cp -n /web/cs1511/20T3/activities/list_increasing/list_increasing.c .</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
Your task is to add code to this function in <b>list_increasing.c</b>:


</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">increasing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="c1">// PUT YOUR CODE HERE (change the next line!)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<b>increasing</b> is given  one argument, <b>head</b>, which is the pointer to the first node in a linked list.
<p>
Add code to <b>increasing</b> so that its returns 1 if the list is in increasing order - the value of each list element is larger than the element before.
</p><p>
For example if the linked list contains these 8 elements:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
1, 7, 8, 9, 13, 19, 21, 42
</pre>
<p>
<b>increasing</b> should return <b>1</b> because  is is increasing order

</p><h4>Testing</h4>
<b>list_increasing.c</b> also contains a <b>main</b> function which allows you to test your <b>increasing</b> function.
<p>
This main function:
</p><ul>
<li> converts the command-line arguments to a linked list
</li><li> assigns a pointer to the first node in the linked list to <b>head</b>
</li><li> calls <b>list_increasing(head)</b>
</li><li> prints the result.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
Do not change this main function.  If you want to change it, you have misread the question.
</p><p>
Your <b>list_increasing</b> function will be called directly in marking.  The main function is only to let you test your <b>list_increasing</b> function
</p><p>
Here is how you use main function allows you to test <b>list_increasing</b>:
</p><p>
</p><pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">dcc list_increasing.c -o list_increasing</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">./list_increasing 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256</kbd>

<kbd is="sh">./list_increasing 2 4 6 5 8 9</kbd>
0
<kbd is="sh">./list_increasing 13 15 17 17 18 19</kbd>
0
<kbd is="sh">./list_increasing 2 4</kbd>
1
<kbd is="sh">./list_increasing 42</kbd>
1
<kbd is="sh">./list_increasing</kbd>
1
</pre>
<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>
<b>increasing</b> should return a single integer.
<p>
<b>increasing</b> should not change the linked list it is given.
Your function should not change the next or data fields of list nodes.
</p><p>
<b>increasing</b> should not use arrays.
</p><p>
<b>increasing</b> should not call malloc.
</p><p>
<b>increasing</b> should not call scanf (or getchar or fgets).
</p><p>
You can assume the linked list only contains positive integers.
</p><p>
<b>increasing</b> should not print anything. It should not call printf.
</p><p>
Do not change the supplied <b>main</b> function. It will not be tested or marked.

<section class="exercise with-pair">
<header><h3><small style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: lowercase;">Exercise â€” in pairs:
    </small><br/>Write tests using capture.c for list_print</h3></header>
<p>This exercise is about writing code to test other code, rather than the usual code that performs
a specific task. You will also be using a multi-file project, including <code>list.c</code> and 
<code>list.h</code>, that have some simple functions to create and print out a linked list. We have 
provided an example <code>list.c</code> and <code>list.h</code>, but your code will be tested
against a different list.c that may not be implemented correctly.</p>
<p>Inside <code>list.c</code> there are two functions that you will use. The first function is <code>nums_to_list</code>
  which takes a <code>length</code>, and an array of integers. It returns a linked list of integers, of length <code>length</code>.
  This function will always work correctly. The second function is <code>print_list</code>, which takes a linked list as it's argument.
  This function will be broken during testing; and it your job to check it works correctly. The function prints out empty lists as <code>X</code>.
  Lists with elements in them are printed like this: <code>1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; X</code>.

</p><p>Your task is to edit <code>list_print_test.c</code> so that it will test whether the function 
  <code>print_list</code> in <code>list.c</code> is working correctly.
  You will write code to perform these tests in each of the empty functions in 
  <code>list_print_test.c</code>.
  Each of these functions will need to use the provided <code>CAPTURE</code> macro; and will also
  probably use the provided <code>string_contains</code> function.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>void test_print_empty_list(void);</code> is an example of what your code should do.
    <strong>You do not need to modify this code.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<code>void test_print_one_elem_list(void);</code> should test whether a list with one element
    is printed out correctly.
  </li>
<li>
<code>void test_print_repeated_elem_list(void);</code> should test whether a list with two
    adjacent elements of the same value is printed out correctly. That is, if you printed out
    the list <code>1 -&gt; 1 -&gt; X</code>, would it print the correct result.
  </li>
<li>
<code>void test_print_ten_elem_list(void);</code> should test whether a list with ten or more
    elements is printed out correctly.
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/activities/list_print_test/list_print_test.zip">
<strong>Download the starter code (list_print_test.zip) here</strong>
</a>
or copy it to your CSE account using the following command:
<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1511 setup_list_print_test</kbd>
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
<p>In this activity, there are 5 files you will be using:

  </p><p>
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/activities/list_print_test/list_print_test.c"><code class="lang-clike">list_print_test.c</code></a>
This file contains the main function, and all the tests. It is <strong>the only file you will need to change in this activity</strong>
</p><p>
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/activities/list_print_test/list.h"><code class="lang-clike">list.h</code></a> contains the definitions of all the list
  related functions in this activity.
<strong>You must not change this file.</strong>
</p><p>
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/activities/list_print_test/list.c"><code class="lang-clike">list.c</code></a> contains the implementation of some simple list-related functions.
<strong>You must not change this file.</strong>
</p><p>
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/activities/list_print_test/capture.h"><code class="lang-clike">capture.h</code></a> contains the definition of a function that allows you to capture the output of your own code, to use in testing. It can only be used in <code>list_print_test.c</code>.
    <strong>You must not change this file.</strong>
</p><p>
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/activities/list_print_test/capture.c"><code class="lang-clike">capture.c</code></a> contains the implementation of functions that allow you to capture the output of your own code, to use in testing. 
    <strong>You must not change this file.</strong>
</p><p>
</p><h4>Autotests</h4>
<p>For this exercise, the autotests will take your <code>list_print_test.c</code> file and compile it with multiple broken solutions; to test how it works. The
  simplest way to test this activity is to use the autotest command. If, however, you wish to have access to these broken solutions directly, you should use the
  <code>1511 list_print_test_compile</code> command. This command has four modes:
  </p><ul>
<li><code>1511 list_print_test_compile normal list_print_test.c</code> will compile your tests against a valid solution.</li>
<li><code>1511 list_print_test_compile one list_print_test.c</code> will compile your tests against a solution that doesn't work when the list contains a single element.</li>
<li><code>1511 list_print_test_compile rpt list_print_test.c</code> will compile your tests against a solution that doesn't work when the list contains a repeated element.</li>
<li><code>1511 list_print_test_compile many list_print_test.c</code> will compile your tests against a solution that doesn't work when the list contains ten or more elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, the command will create an executable called <code>list_print_test</code>.</p>
<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You don't need to test every valid input -- only testing one or two will be enough.
  </li><li>The provided <code>list.c</code> is an example only. Your code will be tested against possibly
      mulitple versions of <code>list.c</code> that are functioning incorrectly in different ways.
  </li><li>Specific instructions for what each of the tests should be testing for is in the comments of 
      <code>list_print_test.c</code>
</li></ul>

    </small><br/>Delete First Element from a Linked List</h3></header>
<p>
Download list_delete_first.c <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/20T3/activities/list_delete_first/list_delete_first.c">here</a>, or copy it to your CSE

</p><pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">cp -n /web/cs1511/20T3/activities/list_delete_first/list_delete_first.c .</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
Your task is to add code to this function in <b>list_delete_first.c</b>:


</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">//</span>
<span class="c1">// Delete the first node in list.</span>
<span class="c1">// The deleted node is freed.</span>
<span class="c1">// The head of the list is returned.</span>
<span class="c1">//</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nf">delete_first</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>





Note <b>list_delete_first.c</b> uses the following familiar data type:

<pre class="program">
struct node {
    struct node *next;
    int          data;
};
</pre>
<b>delete_first</b> is given  one argument, <b>head</b>, which is the pointer to the first node in the linked list.
<p>
Add code to <b>delete_first</b> so that it deletes the first node from list.
</p><p>
<b>delete_first</b> should return a pointer to the new first node in the list.
</p><p>
If the list is now empty <b>delete_first</b> should return <b>NULL</b>.
</p><p>
<b>delete_first</b> should call <b>free</b> to free the memory of the node it deletes.
</p><p>
For example if the linked list contains these 8 elements:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
16, 7, 8, 12, 13, 19, 21, 12
</pre>
<p>
<b>delete_first</b> should return a pointer to a list with these elements:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
7, 8, 12, 13, 19, 21, 12
</pre>
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: this is a simple task requiring only a few lines of code.

</p><h4>Testing</h4>
<b>list_delete_first.c</b> also contains a <b>main</b> function which allows you to test your <b>delete_first</b> function.
It converts command-line arguments to a linked list, calls <b>delete_first</b>, and then prints the result.

Note <b>list_delete_contains.c</b> uses the following familiar data type:

<pre class="program">
struct node {
    struct node *next;
    int          data;
};
</pre>
<b>delete_contains</b> is given  two argument, <b>value</b> and <b>head</b>.
<b>value</b> is an int.
<b>head</b> is the pointer to the first node in a linked list.
<p>
Add code to <b>delete_contains</b> so that it deletes the first node in the linked list
that whose <i>data</i> field equals <b>value</b>.
</p><p>
If <b>value</b> does not occur in the linked list, the list should not be changed.
</p><p>
If <b>value</b> occurs more than once in the linked list, only the first occurrence should be deleted.
</p><p>
<b>delete_contains</b> should return a pointer to the new list.
</p><p>
If the list is now empty <b>delete_contains</b> should return <b>NULL</b>.
</p><p>
<b>delete_contains</b> should call <b>free</b> to free the memory of the node it deletes.
</p><p>
For example if <b>value</b> is <b>12</b> and the linked list contains these 8 elements:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
16, 7, 8, 12, 13, 19, 21, 12

<p>
<b>delete_contains</b> should return a pointer to a list with these elements:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
16, 7, 8, 13, 19, 21, 12
</pre>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<b>list_delete_contains.c</b> also contains a <b>main</b> function which allows you to test your <b>delete_contains</b> function.
<p>
This main function:

<li> converts the command-line arguments to a linked list
</li><li> assigns a pointer to the first node in the linked list to <b>head</b>
</li><li> reads a single integer from standard input and assigns it to <b>value</b>

    struct node *next;
};

struct list_node {
    struct node *my_list;

</pre>
<p>
The <b>node</b> struct is a normal linked list node.
</p><p>
The <b>list_node</b> struct is used to make a linked list where each element 
contains a list of <b>node</b>s.
</p><p>
<b>has_diagonal</b> should take a pointer to the head of a <b>list_node</b> list
and return a 1 if it finds a diagonal or a 0 if it doesn't. A diagonal in this
exercise means that the first number in the first list is the same as the second
number in the second list and the third number in the third list and so on.
</p><p>
For example if the list of lists looks like this:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
list_node 0 contains the list {5, 0, 0}
list_node 1 contains the list {0, 5, 0}
list_node 2 contains the list {0, 0, 5}

list_node 3 contains the list {0, 0, 0, 5}
</pre>
<p>
<b>has_diagonal</b> should return 0, because the 2nd element of the second list
does not equal the value of the first element of the first list.
</p><h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>

<p>
Welcome to the Game of Chairs, where you either win or have your memory freed.
</p><p>
<b>musical_chairs</b> is written using the following structs that cannot be changed:
</p><p>
</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// player in the game of chairs</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">player</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">MAX_NAME_LENGTH</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="c1">// A node in a linked list of chairs</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">chair</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">player</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">sitting</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">chair</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">next</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
The <b>chair</b> struct is a linked list node.
</p><p>
The <b>player</b> struct represents a player that can sit on a chair
(represented by the chair's pointer aiming at the player).
</p><p>
<b>make_music</b> is given a pointer to a <b>chair</b>, which is the
first element in a list of chairs. It is also given an int <b>turns</b>
which represents how many turns of movement there will be before
the music stops.
</p><p>Like the game of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_chairs">Musical Chairs</a>,
this program will have players move along the linked list, changing
which chair they're sitting in.
</p><p>In <b>make_music</b>, every player moves <b>turns</b> spaces along
the linked list. Anyone who moves off the end of the linked list, should
then move to the head of the list, so the players will end up rotating
through the list as if it's a loop. This would be similar to if the
<b>next</b> of the last chair was aimed at the first chair.
</p><p>Once all the players have finished moving, the head of the list of
chairs is removed. This means both that chair and the player sitting in
it are removed from the game. 
</p><p><b>make_music</b> should then print out the name of the player that
was removed.
</p><p>Be careful to make sure you free all memory used in this game!
</p><p>
For example if a list of chairs called <b>thrones</b> looks like this:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
throne points at the player named "Spoiler Alert"
throne points at the player named "Eddard Stark"
throne points at the player named "Joffrey Baratheon"
throne points at the player named "Cersei Lannister"
throne points at the player named "Robert Baratheon"
</pre>
<p>
Then the following function is called:
</p><p>
</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">make_music</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">thrones</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
The output would be:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
Joffrey Baratheon
</pre>
<p>
and the resulting linked list would look like this:
</p><p>
</p><pre>
(throne pointed at "Joffrey Baratheon" but was removed)
throne points at the player named "Cersei Lannister"
throne points at the player named "Robert Baratheon"
throne points at the player named "Spoiler Alert"
throne points at the player named "Eddard Stark"
</pre>
<p>
In this list, all the players have moved down 3 chairs and are now sitting in
different chairs. Anyone that moved past the end of the chairs was moved back
to the top of the list of chairs.
</p><h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>
<p>
You can assume the list provided to <code>make_music</code> will not be empty.
You can assume the number of turns will not be negative.
</p><p>
<b>struct player</b> and <b>struct chair</b> cannot be edited. They must be
used as they are.
</p><p>
The <b>be_seated</b> function will help you create chairs. It cannot be edited
and must be used as it is.
</p><p>
You may not use arrays in this solution. Arrays are not necessary to 
complete this task.
</p><p>
You must free all memory used in your program. Use 
<code>dcc --leak-check</code> if you need to check for memory leaks. Autotest
will also check your code for leaks
Your submitted file may contain a main function. It will not be tested or marked.
